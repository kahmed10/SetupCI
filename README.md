This is the initial phase of SetupCI, a tool that performs regression testing on installation guides. Current support will begin with GitHub projects that have a .md file to parse.

Before using this tool, run the following setup script:
```
./install.sh
```
[//]: # (CI_RUN_UBUNTU(./install.sh))
[//]: # (CI_RUN_MACOS(./install.sh))
